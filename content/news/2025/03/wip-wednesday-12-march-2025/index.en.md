This week in FreeCAD development:

**Draft**: Roy_043 fixed several bugs, including Draft's fillet not working the first time you try it, as well as incorrect snapping behavior. He also implemented a new Dim Auto Flip Text option to disable automatic text orientation based on where you click first.

**BIM**:

- Syres916 fixed two cosmetic bugs in the UI code.

- furgo16 re-enabled adding Arch Space boundaries.

**Sketcher**: Shkolik fixed the projection of B-Splines from parallel planes by reusing LinkStage3 code with minor modifications.

**Part/PartDesign**: j-hap and captain0xff contributed a couple of fixes, and WandererFan updated some properties and spinboxes to use newer properties such as PropertyDirection and spinboxes such as QuantitySpinBox.

**FEM**:

- marioalexis84 improved the Magnetization, the Heat Flux, and the Gmsh task panels. He also used disambiguation for solid references in Elmer equation task panels.

- NewJoker added a new FEM example: rigid body constraint with CalculiX.

**Assembly**: PaddleStroke made it possible to select LCS elements when the LCS is in a body. He also fixed the use of datum axes in joints.

**User interface**:

- tringenbach fixed the NaviCube scale on HiDPI / Retina displays.

- alfrix cleaned up the general task panel code to unify its look across operating systems and make the styling apply faster.

**Among other changes**:

- furgo16 brought back the ability to specify multiple custom folders whose contents will be shown as a combined set of files in the "Custom Folder" file card on the Start page. This was a v0.21 feature.

- kpemartin fixed a bug where the Measure tool crash the application if you measured the same amount twice.
