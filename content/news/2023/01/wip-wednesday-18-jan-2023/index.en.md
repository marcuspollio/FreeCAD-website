Things are relatively quiet in the FreeCAD development world this week. There's a lot of bug-hunting going on, of course, and many developers are preparing to meet at FOSDEM 2023 in a couple of weeks for the FreeCAD Day meetup. There's still time to [apply for a grant](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fosdem-travel-grants) to join us if you are interested!

Here are this week's development highlights:

- The big item for the week is a virtual developers' meeting about the toponaming merge: on Friday, 20 January, 15:00 central European time (UTC+1) we are going to discuss the next step in that process. Interested developers should contact @uwestoehr on the FreeCAD Forums for an invitation link.

- @sliptonic has merged [PR 8186](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8186) for issue 8185 (Deburr offset problems), and is continuing tapping operation work Draft [PR 8069](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8069), and reviewing all issues related to unnecessary Z height moves.

- @openBrain hopes to submit the PR for the Continuous Integration (CI) improvements this week. It will remain a work-in-progress, but is ready for preliminary rollout.

- @wandererfan is engaged in what he calls "pest control" this week. In particular there is a Mac OS-specific bug with dimensioning that is a high priority to resolve.

- @wmayer continues to work towards full Qt6-compatibility, this week cleaning up a lot of old-style signal-and-slot usage.

- @jnxd and @abdullahtahiriyo continue to make steady progress improving the Sketcher B-Spline code. This work is partially funded by an [FPA Development Fund grant](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement).
