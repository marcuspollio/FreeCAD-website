This week in FreeCAD development:

- The new Assembly solver, [OndselSolver](https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/OndselSolver/), was added as a git submodule. This is a major step towards having a working version of an integrated assembly workbench.

- **@wwmayer** applied clang-format to the Base section of the code, taking one step further towards standardizing our code formatting.

- **@paddle** continued his work on the Sketcher DrawSketchHandler (DSH) system, merging the new Arc Slot tool.

- **@adrianinsaval** is putting the finishing touches on the release of 0.21.2

- I (**@chennes**) am working on the Toponaming merge, working on the caching methods in TopoShape.
